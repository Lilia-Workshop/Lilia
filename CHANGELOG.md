## New commands

Nothing, for now.....

## Old commands reworks/removals

- `osu` commands response reworked
  - Better readability on responses
  - Paginated response if you are requesting scores
  - String literal minor update
- `mod` commands reworked
  - `ban`, `kick`, `warnadd` and `warnremove` are merged into `mod general execute`
  - DM an embed to user instead of a wall-of-text

## Codebase changes (don't care if you don't plan to contribute to the source)

- Added `ModerationLog` field in user database
